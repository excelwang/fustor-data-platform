Test: Future Mtime Suspect Lifecycle (Layer 1 — replaces test_i integration logic).

Validates the full lifecycle of a file with mtime ahead of the watermark:
  1. mtime > watermark → marked suspect
  2. After clock catches up and sentinel verifies → suspect cleared
  3. Edge case: mtime == watermark (boundary)
