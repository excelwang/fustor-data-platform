Test: Large File Writing Suspect Maintenance (Recovers deleted test_c6).

Validates that a file being actively written (non-atomic partial writes)
remains suspect throughout the write process even as multiple MODIFY events
arrive, and is only cleared when the final CLOSE_WRITE atomic event arrives.
