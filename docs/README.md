# Fustor Documentation

Welcome to the Fustor documentation. Fustor is a high-reliability, consistency-aware data synchronization platform designed for NFS, S3, MySQL CDC, and other data sources. It can sync data from multiple sources to a central fustord service, which then serves as a single source of truth for the data, using various views like dir tree and graph

## Core Concepts

- **Pipe**: The fundamental unit of synchronization, connecting a **Source** to a **Sender**.
- **Source**: A data origin (e.g., local FS, MySQL CDC, S3).
- **Sender**: A data destination (e.g., fustord API, S3, HTTP Hook).
- **View**: A materialized state of the data in the destination system (fustord).
- **datacast**: The process that runs pipes and captures local events.
- **fustord**: The central state manager that performs arbitration and serves the data.

## Getting Started

To get started with development, please ensure you have `uv` installed and run:

```bash
uv sync --all-packages
```

Refer to the root `README.md` for environmental setup and running tests.
